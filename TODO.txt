KD-tree
=======
- Fix memory leaks
- Make fit for DIM != 3
- Check FLANN
- fix function naming etc
- Backport fixes to Java

PH-Tree
=======
- Use PhTree<Key, T> i.o. PhTree<DIM, T>. This allows dynamic dimensionality....
  -> Using Key::size() may still result in loop unrolling if array::size() is a constexpr! -> Check!
  -> This may really help with with kNN! Avoids constant conversion for calculating distances...
     -> Should help with FILTERs and CALLBACKs as well, again because it avoids conversion.
- Try convert-on-access, i.e. store unconverted coordinates
- Require values to be movable?
  -> This is already the case for relocate(), or not?
  -> disallow non-primitive values? -> This would simplify many areas:
     - Entry
     - relocate()  --> including relocate many...? -> SImply move into vector<>
     - B+trees?
     - remove all std::forward etc.
- Create version 2.0:
  - simpler Filter ->   operator() / lambdas
  - relocate:
    - remove count-equals
    - allow custom std::equals()?
  - return std::pair<Key&, Val&>  /  struct <Key&, Val&, distance>
  - Use /** comment format for functions/classes (?)
  - emplace() to return iterator (or similar) i.o. pair!
  - remove post-increment iterators!
  - Change distance functions to avoid sqrt() for internal distances (e.g. in kNN)


General
=======
- remove PCL / ttvd
- use valgrind "massif" to check memory consumption: https://valgrind.org/docs/manual/ms-manual.html
